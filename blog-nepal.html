									<h1>"Chasing angels or fleeing demons, go to the mountains."</h1>
									<p>Mountains, lakes, medieval cities and temples and vibrant culture – Nepal has almost everything. This small Himalayan country is the Holy Grail for adventure lovers. Some of the most iconic hiking trails of Himalayas are found in Nepal.</p>
									
									<p>The country is for all types of travellers. Nepal is the land of high mountains. Eight of the world’s highest peaks can be found in Nepal. Not only that the place can give you the ultimate adrenaline rush with its adventure activities like bungee jumping, paragliding, white water rafting and a helicopter ride above the Everest. For wildlife lovers too, Nepal offers a wide range of experiences.

Those who love cities and ancient culture, Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur will definitely strike a chord. The old lanes and alleys of these medieval cities have something so upbeat and unique about them. Though Nepal is a Hindu nation, the country is also the birthplace of Lord Buddha. So you will definitely come across serene stupas and fluttering prayer flags across the country. Lumbini is the birthplace of Lord Buddha and is one of the must-visit places in Nepal.</p><br><br>

									<h3>Dashain- The biggest festival of Nepal</h3>
									<p>Dashain festival is one of the most widely celebrated festivals of Nepal. The victory of Goddess Durga over the devil Mahishasura is celebrated during Dashain through worships, feast, fairs and family gatherings. Nepalis also celebrate Dashain festival for the fertility of the land and good harvest. Ghatasthapana is the first day of the festival and the last day is known as Kojagrat Purnima. Seventh day is celebrated with phulpati or sacred flowers and Brahmins carry kalasha with jamara and bamboo stalk from Gorkha to Kathmandu. Animal sacrifices are common on the 8th and 9th day of Dashain, in Nepal. Vijayadashami is celebrated on the 10th day when friends and families meet to exchange greetings and blessings.</p>

									<h3>Tihar- The shinning festival of Nepal</h3>
									<p>Tihar festival is a grand celebration of 5 days, right after Dashain festival. Known as ‘festival of lights’, Tihar is celebrated by worshipping Goddess Laxmi with vigour and enthusiasm. Numerous candles and lanterns are lit up in front of the idol, to mark the end of evil days and commencement of prosperous times.

Along with worship of Goddess Laxmi, on the first two days people worship crows and dogs, cows on the third day and oxen on the fourth day. The 5th day is celebrated with Bhai tika- where sisters put tika on the forehead of their brothers praying for their long life. The Newar community celebrates Mha puja on the fourth day as well.</p>
<h2>Must Visit Temples in Nepal</h2>
<h3>1. Swayambhunath Stupa</h3>
	<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-4.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
<p>Located on a hill 2km west of Thamel, Swayambhunath offers great views across the city. It’s a particularly holy place for Nepal’s Tantric Buddhists.

It’s nicknamed the ‘monkey temple’ and as soon as you arrive, it’ll soon become clear why as you see monkeys crawling up the stone steps to the temple.</p>



<h3>2. Boudhanath Stupa</h3>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-5.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
<p>To the east of central Kathmandu, this is considered to be the holiest Tibetan Buddhist site outside of Tibet.

The surrounding area is a hub of Tibetan life and culture in Nepal and is a must-see destination if you’re visiting Kathmandu.</p>



<h3>3. Changunarayan Temple</h3>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-6.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
<p>This is the least-visited of all of Kathmandu Valley’s heritage sites, but is a shame to miss.

The two-story Vishnu temple at the top of the hill is said to be the oldest temple in Nepal, and represents a turning point in Nepali architecture and culture.</p>

<h3>4. Budhanilkantha</h3>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-7.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
<p>Located on the northern edge of the valley, this is a unique place, as the large stone Vishnu statue is depicted lying in a pool of water surrounded by serpents.

You can combine a trip here with a walk in the nearby Shivapuri National Park, further up the hill.</p>



<h3>5. Dakshinkali</h3>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-8.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
<p>This Kali temple, on the southern edge of the Kathmandu Valley, is where animal sacrifices (especially of goats and chickens) are made.

Only visit here if you’re not squeamish at the sight of blood.</p>

<h3>6. Pashupatinath</h3>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-9.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
<p>This is Nepal’s most holy Hindu site. Located on the banks of the Bagmati River that runs through Kathmandu, it’s always abuzz with pilgrims and sadhus (Hindu holy men).

This is a place of somber worship, as Pashupatinath is also the city’s most important cremation ground.</p>

<h3>7. Manakamana</h3>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-10.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
<p>From the highway town of Kurintar, located on the Trisuli River between Kathmandu and Pokhara, is a long and scenic cable car leading up to the Manakamana temple.

Although the temple itself is being rebuilt after destruction in the 2015 earthquake, it still attracts many pilgrims from around India and Nepal, who believe their wishes will be granted if they pray here.

The ride up on the cable car is stunning and makes for a fantastic day trip from Pokhara or Kathmandu.</p>

<h3>8. Muktinath</h3>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-11.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
<p>This Hindu and Buddhist pilgrimage site is located deep (and high) in the mountains, at 3710m.

As well as pilgrims, trekkers in the Mustang and Annapurna region of the Himalayas frequently make the trip here.</p>

<h3>9. The Three Durbar Squares in Kathmandu Valley</h3>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-12.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
<p>Kathmandu Durbar Square, with its eclectic mix of architectural styles; Patan Durbar Square, with its fine museum; and Bhaktapur Durbar Square, an open-air museum of traditional crafts, are fantastic places to soak up the local culture and colorful atmosphere.</p>

<h2>NEPAL’S GREATEST TREKKING PEAKS</h2>

<h3>Island Peak (6160m)</h3>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-13.jpeg" alt="" /></span>


<p>Island Peak or Imja Tse named for floating its appearance of floating like a ship in a sea of ice is the most popular trekking peak in Nepal. Between 2006 and 2010 over 12,000 climbers attempted the summit. Lying in the Everest region the route to the base camp for Island Peak starts from Lukla so is easily accessible. The main challenges are snow at the summit and lack of acclimatization.</p>
<h3>Cholatse (6440m)</h3>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-14.jpeg" alt="" /></span>



<p>Cholatse is a steep walled peak that and is one of the most difficult trekking peaks. Attracting mountaineers from around the world its not for first timers. Viewable from Gokyo Ri it seperates the Gokyo and Khumbu Valleys and is accessed via several days of trekking from Lukla. The peak was not climbed until 1982 when the first climbing permit was issued and was the last named peak in the Khumbu Region to be scaled.</p>

<h3>Lobuje Far East (6119m)</h3>

<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-15.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

<p>Lobuje towers above the Khumbu Glacier on the opposite side of Mount Everest. It really consists of two peaks Lobuje East (often referenced as Lobuje West – 6145m) and Lobuje Far East (6119m). The peak is often climbed by parties later seeking to summit Everest as an acclimatization climb. The peak requires more mountaineering skills than either Island or Mera peak.</p>

<h3>Larkya (6249m)</h3>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-16.jpeg" alt="" /></span>



<p>Larkya is often climbed as part of the Manaslu Trek and is physically taxing climb that requires a tough slog through the snow. Those reaching the summit are rewarded with great views of Manaslu and the Annapurnas. Sano Larkya is a secondary summit that can be reached in a single day from base camp. Those attempting to summit the main peak will need to set up a second camp above base camp.</p>

<h3>Pisang Peak (6091m)</h3>

<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-17.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

<p>Pisang Peak is often climbed in combination with the classic Annapurna Circuit. It is a 3+ day round trip from Manang for those who are already properly acclimatized. A high camp is at 5200m and above that the upper ridge is guarded by imposing rock outcrop. It is slightly more difficult to summit then Island Peak.</p>

<h3>Yala Peak (5520m)</h3>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-18.jpeg" alt="" /></span>


<p>Yala Peak is one of the easier trekking peaks and a great for first timers looking to summit a peak in Nepal. Its in the Langtang region which is easily accessible by ground transport from Kathmandu. Count on 20 days to get from the start of the trek to the summit and return. Shishapangma (8013m) the highest peak in Tibet is visible from the summit. The trekking portion through the Langtang region is pleasant with comfortable tea houses and is a great way to skip the crowds of the Everest region.</p>

<h3>Mera Peak (6,654 m)</h3>


<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-19.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
<p>Mera Peak is the tallest trekking peak and the second most popular in Nepal. In fact between, 2006 and 2010 it was attempted by nearly 6000 people. One has views of 5 of the 10 world’s tallest peaks from the summit. It a fairly easy peak in technical terms only requiring a short trek across glacial ice to reach the summit. The starting point for trekkers is Lukla in the Everest region. Despite the fact that it is technically easy its suggested to give yourself 10 to 14 days to acclimatize before approaching the summit.</p>

<h3>Tent Peak (5663m)</h3>
<span class="image main"><img src="images/nepal-20.jpeg" alt="" /></span>


<p>Tent peak lies in the middle of the Annapurna Sanctuary giving amazing views of the surrounding peaks including 8000m+ Annapurna I, Annapurna South, Fang and Machhapuchhre (Fish Tail). It’s possible to do this with a 2-week itinerary from Pokhara and combines great tea house trekking with a challenging peak at the conclusion.

This is just a brief review of a few of the 28 trekking peaks that Nepal has to offer. The Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA) has designated trekking peaks as either “A” or “B” category. The designation has to do with the timing of and has nothing to do with the difficulty level of the peak. It’s important to note this only because of the difference in the fee structure. Permits for “A” peaks cost $350 and permits for “B” peaks cost $500 for groups of up to four people.</p>
