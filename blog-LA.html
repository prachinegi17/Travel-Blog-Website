									<p>Located on Avalon Bay, The Pavillion Hotel is a cute spot with island vibes and a really great happy hour. The rooms are decorated with vintage Catalina Island posters, the beds are comfy and the location is literal perfection. Breakfast is included every morning (hello omelette bar!) and we really can’t think of a better way to enjoy it than staring out at the bay. And don’t forget to head down to wine and cheese hour from 4:30-5:30pm every night. Good wine, great views. You really can’t go wrong.</p>
									<p>If you’re looking for adventure mixed with history about the wildlife and ecosystem of Catalina Island, this tour is for you. Starting at 600 feet above sea level, you will zip line your way down the island with views of the ocean and the mountains that you just don’t get anywhere else. It’s a GORGEOUS year to do this too because all of the wild flowers are blooming. So fun.</p>
									<p>While you are on the island, you should treat yourself to a nice night out at the Avalon Grille. The ambiance is perfect for a date night or a girls night out for drinks. The food is delicious, the drinks are just as good and with views of the bay, it really makes for a lovely night out. Plus, instead of bread they start your dinner with Tajin and lime flavored popcorn. So cute! If you’re in the mood for seafood (which we were because duh. We’re on an island!) order the salmon. You won’t regret it.</p>
