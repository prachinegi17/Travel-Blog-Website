										<h1>The January River( Rio De Janeiro)</h1>

									<p>Sunshine, samba, and sports: these three words are pretty perfect when it comes to describing one of the most popular cities in South America; Rio de Janeiro! Though, if I’m honest, these are only the tip of the iceberg of all the best things to do in Rio de Janeiro.

It’s a city that has something for everyone. 
</p>Rio is famed for its beautiful beaches, annual carnival and stunning natural vistas which intertwine with the city. This all means that there’s more than enough reason to find yourself wanting to visit.

This is why I wanted to share some of the best things to do in Rio de Janeiro when you visit next. Though, as with all destinations, always listen to local advice on safety and don’t wear anything too overt or mountains of bling. 

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/rio2.jpg" alt="" /></span>

									
									<p>Probably the most iconic statue in the world, Christ the Redeemer stands at 98 feet (30 m) tall. Looming over Rio de Janeiro at a staggering total height of 2,300 feet, it’s easily one of the best things to see. Plus, talk about a view!

Now, located on the summit of Mount Corcovado, the statue is the result of the combined efforts of three individuals: French sculptor Paul Landowski, Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, and French engineer Albert Caquot.

This all kinda keeps with Rio’s diverse people and cultures.</p>

<span class="image main"><img src="images/rio3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
<p>The 1,300 foot (396 m) tall Sugarloaf Mountain is a rather popular sight to visit in Rio…and one that (understandably) always makes me think food!

A two-part cable car trip to the top offers 360-degree views of the city, as well as the surrounding ocean and lush green forests.
<P>Several fast-food restaurants are located on the top of the mountain,so you can grab a bite to eat up there while taking in the gorgeous views. If you’d rather walk, there is a trail that wraps around the mountain.
	<span class="image main"><img src="images/rio4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
	<P>While being in Rio for its famous Carnival would be AMAZING, Samba-season fun can be had year-round with a Samba City Tour! The tour has visitors explore the venue where the floats for Carnival are prepared, as well as where the dancers can practice their Samba routines.

Visitors will also get to experience a musical performance, and then be able to try playing instruments used during Carnival. Costume making is also on display, allowing visitors to see the beautiful costumes getting prepped for next year’s Carnival. Tours are every day except for Tuesdays and are available in English and Portuguese.</P>

<span class="image main"><img src="images/rio5.jpg" alt="" /></span>
<p>The Rio Carnival is one of the most talked-about and popular nation-wide carnivals in the world. A blast of colors, costumes, energy, and fun, the Rio Carnival is a must visit for every person who would love the opportunity of being a part of a community that celebrates together. The carnival is all set to jive on the beats of local music and offer an experience of a lifetime to its visitors</p>
<P>The final parade and samba dances will be hosted by Rio’s Sambodromo where approximately 50 different samba schools are expected to display their parades and dances based on a particular theme. The parades are a sight to behold. The Sambadromo welcomes more than 80,000 viewers every year during the carnival. They represent the Brazilian culture, displaying the best they have through their art and giving the audience an experience of a lifetime.</P>
<P>Brazilians celebrate this week-long carnival as a pre-lent party. Lent is a six-week long observation and fasting period that people of the Christian community follow.  It is a symbol of respect and acknowledgment towards Jesus Christ’s holy sacrifice. People fast on food and avoid all kinds of celebrations for these 40 days which is succeeded by Easter.
